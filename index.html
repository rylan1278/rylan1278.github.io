          <p>
            Hi, I’m <strong>Rylan Reasoner</strong>, a student-athlete at the 
            <strong>University of Indianapolis</strong>, where I compete as part of the Swimming & Diving team.

          <p>
            Beyond athletics, I’m passionate about Computer Science, development, and programming. 
            I’m pursuing my Bachelor’s in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics and SWEN.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Outside of academics and athletics, I enjoy exploring technology and entertainment. 
            I play online games, particularly ones that let me connect with friends, and I am a VR enthusiast.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spend my time in the pool, studying, or gaming with friends. I enjoy puzzles like Wordle and Sudoku.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maintaining balance between sports, academics, gaming, and side projects keeps me motivated and challenged.

        <h3>Mock - Rate My Professor: Full Stack</h3>
        <p>
          Designed and built a fully functional "Rate My Professor" mock web application to demonstrate full stack development skills.
          Created the database using <strong>phpMyAdmin</strong> with relational tables for professors, courses, and ratings.
          The front-end interface was built using <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>, and included dynamic forms for users to submit and update ratings.
          This project emphasized database design, data validation, and responsive front-end layouts.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Skills/Tools:</strong> PHP, MySQL, phpMyAdmin, HTML, CSS</p>

        <p>
          Extended a pre-made full stack shopping application by implementing dynamic <strong>Svelte</strong> pages that update based on the item index in the URL.
          Added functionality for items to include price, priority, and description.
          Developed secure backend access using <strong>FastAPI</strong> to manage item updates, preventing front-end users from editing the backend directly.
          Focused on integrating front-end and back-end logic seamlessly while maintaining data security.

          <h2>Welcome!</h2>
          <p>Welcome to my website! I’m <strong>Rylan Reasoner</strong>, a student-athlete at the <strong>University of Indianapolis</strong> where I compete as part of the Swimming & Diving team.</p>
          <p>Beyond athletics, I’m passionate about computer science and programming. I’m working toward my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics and SWEN.</p>
          <p>On this site, you’ll find my <a href="#" onclick="document.querySelector('[data-tab=info]').click()">resume / personal info</a>, <a href="#" onclick="document.querySelector('[data-tab=projects]').click()">projects</a>, and more about me outside of school and sports.</p>

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Outside of academics and athletics, I spend a lot of time exploring technology and entertainment. I enjoy playing online games with friends and exploring VR experiences.</p>
          <p>I try to maintain a balance between swimming, school, gaming, and side projects. Each keeps me engaged and pushes me to improve.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>Here are some of my projects:</p>

      <p><strong>Mock - Rate My Professor: Full Stack</strong><br>
      Developed a mock “Rate my Professor” application fully from scratch using phpMyAdmin for database management and HTML/CSS for the front-end. Implemented user authentication, professor profiles, and a dynamic rating system.</p>

      <p><strong>Mock - “Shopping” App: Full Stack</strong><br>
      Took an existing full stack application and extended it by creating Svelte pages that update dynamically via item index in the URL. Each item displays price, priority, and description, with secure backend modifications through FastAPI inaccessible to front-end users.</p>

      <p><strong>Web3D Golf Game</strong><br>
      Built a Web3D golf game using THREE.js and A-Frame, featuring a homemade physics engine and collision detection system. Implemented strategic golfing mechanics such as variable ball velocity, trajectory calculation, and obstacle handling. Hosted at <a href="https://rylan1278.github.io/Strategist" target="_blank">rylan1278.github.io/Strategist</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Custom Gemini Web Page</strong><br>
      Created a web page that communicates directly with Google Gemini using N8N workflows, API integration, and webhooks. Managed formatting and secure data transfer between frontend and Gemini API endpoints.</p>
